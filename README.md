## Installation

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/andybzn/magic-8-ball --bin magic8
```

## Usage

Ask the ball a question, and an answer will be returned. 

```bash
# Ask the ball a question
magic8 "your question goes here"

# Return just the answer text
magic8 -a "your question goes here"
magic8 --answer-only "will I order pizza tonight?"

# Return the question and answer as a json object
magic8 -j "your question goes here"
magic8 --json "or will I order chinese takeout?"
```

If a question is asked with no arguments, the returned answer will be color coded (colors use the terminal color palette) based on the tone of the answer:

- Green -> good news
- Yellow -> non-committal
- Red -> bad juju
